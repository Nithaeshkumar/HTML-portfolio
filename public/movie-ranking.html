<h1>The best movies according to Nithaesh Kumar</h1>
<h2>My top 2 movies of all time</h2>

<h3>Bengalore days</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm from Tamilnadu (Tamilian). I can very much speak & understand Malayalam. One thing I want to highlight a point is that Malayalam Film industry especially in the past one decade has gone to the height of World classics... Anjali Menon's contribution to Malayalam Film industry is one of the remarkable count. Yes, she does it again with Bangalore Days... Kudos to her. I have seen this Movie, yesterday at Chennai. Very pleasant & enjoyable ride.... All the actors did their best. Especially, Fahad Fazil,Dulquar Salman,Nivin Pauly & cute smiling angel Nazriya does their roles perfectly. Once again, Anjali keep rocking. I love to watch all your future movies .... </p>
<h3>Captian miller</h3>
<p>This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes.</p>
